<p class="LeftText">These are pictures from my most recent trip to New York and other parts of the East Coast. My family and I went on a 5 day vacation to New York City and to Boston. </p>
<p class="RightText">It was a fun trip and I was amazed at the size of New York compared to Chicago. It is a much busier city and was a very cool experience.</p>
